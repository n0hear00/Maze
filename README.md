# Maze

Maze-Solving Algorithm for Buutti Oy.
Part of Their Job Application Process.

Algorithm that finds a route through 2 mazes given in .txt files. Each file has a map that is made of different symbols. '#' represents a block, ' ' is a movable space and 'E' means exit. The starting position is marked with '^'.

The algorithm tries to pass both maps with 20, 150, and 200 moves. The algorithm adds more moves automatically if necessary. Once the algorithm finds the solution it stops, sends a message to the terminal and the answer is printed on a .txt file.
